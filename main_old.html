						<span>Take your team to the extreme with customized music, choreography and training from Extreme Athletics, led by Sam Owens, head coach of the University of Minnesota Spirit Squad.</span>
						<p></p>
						<span>Extreme Athletics is founded on the principle of building great kids through the sport of cheerleading.  Coach Owens started in 1999, providing athletes and coaches with customized content and professional instruction designed specifically for the unique needs of their teams.  Good sportsmanship, safety, personal development and healthy competition are the goals for every Extreme Team!</span>
						<p></p>
						<span>Routines are carefully choreographed for each team and athletes are thoroughly instructed by experienced and professionally trained staff. Each routine is designed to challenge athletes while staying within the skill level of the team.  Instruction is provided using proper techniques and without compromising safety.</span>
						<p></p>
						<div class="paraTitle"><b>Be Your Best!</b></div><span>Extreme Athletics provides physical, emotional and intellectual coaching to young athletes through cheerleading, dance and music.  Its coaches focus on developing youth into emotionally and physically strong adults by helping each athlete reach his/her highest potential.  Athletes earn self esteem and pride from performing intense, disciplined routines that showcase their talent and skills.  Responsibility, a sense of belonging and sportsmanship are felt by working with other athletes and competing against other teams.</span>
						<p></p>
						<div class="paraTitle"><b>Feel the Success!</b></div><span>With successful training comes a sense of pride and accomplishment that lead to positive attitudes and life changing outcomes.

						<p>"Extreme Athletics has taken our program to the next level.  Because of working with Coach Owens, we have gained higher recognition throughout the state.  The kids love working with him because of his energy and high standards! We would not be where we are today without his choreography and high expectations for the kids."</p>
						<p>-Sara Gale, Head Coach<br>Germantown High School<br>Germantown, Wisconsin</p>
						<p>
						</p><p>"Extreme Athletics is one of the best things that ever happened to Lakeville.  Not only does it offer quality camps and instruction, its programs are geared toward the specific needs of each cheerleading squad.  The instructors are amazing and they have enabled my teams to perform at a higher level every year we work with them.  Coach Owens is a phenomenal choreographer who knows more than just how to do a good routine; he knows how to motivate cheerleaders to perform.  He is the quintessential choreographer for Lakeville, and his ideologies and methodologies align with what our school needs: quality, reliability and honesty."</p>
						<p>-Susan Link, Head Coach<br>Lakeville North High School<br>Lakeville, Minnesota</p>
						<p>
						</p><p>"It is our privilege to know and work with Sam Owens.  He has added so much through the years to our daughter’s cheerleading experience.  Sam is an outstanding motivator, wonderful choreographer, creates great routines, and really is a tremendous positive influence on our daughter and her entire team. With Sam’s help, our daughter’s team met their goal of being top 10 in the nation this year.   Thank you for everything you do for the girls and our program."</p>
						<p>-Kevin and Lori Davidson<br>Lakeville, Minnesota</p>
						<p>
						</p><p>"Our daughter Morgan has had the opportunity to work with Sam Owens for the past 5 years and in our eyes, he is more than 'just a coach/choreographer'.  He is a great motivator and team builder with the skills to get the team (and Morgan) to focus on the things that are really important in cheerleading and in life.  Thank you for all you do…you are definitely appreciated!"</p>

The wife is laying down refusing to talk to the husband after he spent the whole night hanging out with his drinking buddys while she sat at home alone during their date night that she took 4 weeks planning, even pulling a lot of favors to have someone else watch the kids and making sure neither of them had to go to work the following morning.  Sadly this is far from the first time he's done this, as evidenced by the fact that this is his seventh marriage in the last four years alone, and if he isn't careful from here on out, he'll be thrown out of the den with his golf clubs again and have to spend the rest of his life as a bachelor with child support bills for 30 kids.<br /><a href="http://www.wallpapersis.com/wallpaper/rodent-on-the-lookout-family.html">Link</a></div>
